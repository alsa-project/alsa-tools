Use the card specified by card-number rather than the first card.
This is equivalent with \fI-Dhw:n\fP option where \fIn\fP is the card number.

\fI-D\fP control-name
Use the card specified by control-name rather than the first card,
normally this will be of the form hw:\fIn\fP where \fIn\fP is the sound
card number (zero-based). This is only needed if you have more than one
Envy24-based card or if your Envy24 card is not configured as the first
card in your ALSA driver setup.
